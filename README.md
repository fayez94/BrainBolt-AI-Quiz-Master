## ðŸŒŸ BrainBolt - AI Quiz Master
BrainBolt is an AI-powered Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) generator built using LangChain and OpenAI's GPT model. This tool processes text input (from PDF or TXT files), generates MCQs, evaluates their complexity, and formats them for easy readability. The project is developed with Streamlit for an interactive UI.  

## ðŸš€ Features

1. **MCQ Generation:** Creates structured multiple-choice questions from input text.  

2. **AI-Powered Evaluation:** Reviews question complexity and adjusts tone accordingly.  

3. **PDF/TXT Support:** Extracts text from PDF and TXT files.  

4. **Logging System:** Tracks process execution and errors.  

5. **Streamlit UI:** User-friendly interface for easy interaction.
